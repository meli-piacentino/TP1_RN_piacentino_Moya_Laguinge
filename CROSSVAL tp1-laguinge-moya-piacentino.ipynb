Esto demuestra un sesgo debido a que, como estamos trabajando con tres clases diferentes (contradiction, entailment y neutral) lo que debería ocurrir es un accuracy inicial cercano el 33% (igual de probable para las tres clases).\n","Este sesgo puede deberse a que, como se escribe en el paper provisto por la cátedra, el conjunto de datos presenta ciertas particularidades que inicialmente facilitan la clasificación. Entre ellas son la importante presencia de ciertas palabras y la longitud de la oración. Procedemos a explicar en mayor detalle para cada una de las clases.\n","En cuanto a la clase entailment, esta cuenta con una amplia gama de palabras genéricas, aproximaciones numéricas y eliminación de géneros, así como también cierta vaguedad en la descripción de lugares; en cuanto a nuetral, hay una presencia importante de adjetivos modifiadores y superlativos, es decir, palabras que introducen información que no está obviamente implícita en la premisa, pero que es plausible.Por último, en cuanto a contradiction, hay una fuerte presencia de palabras de negación (como nadie, no, nunca y nada) así como palabras que no son inherentemente negativas pero sin contradictorias a muchos escenarios (como dormir, que contradice cualquier otra actividad y desnudo, quecontradice cualquier descripción de la ropa).\n","\n","Tras ejecutar el algoritmo de cross-validation se obtuvo, con Naïve Bayes, un accuracy de 0.639122 lo cual no representó un cambio significativo respecto a la clasificación de entrada."]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"D9NrT-z-JBvq"},"source":["#resultados de NBMN con solamente un modelo"]},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"id":"EkWsh9UwgXPw","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1633394567454,"user_tz":180,"elapsed":368,"user":{"displayName":"Maria Teresita Laguinge","photoUrl":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a/default-user=s64","userId":"16772265715389943262"}}},"source":["text_train_filtered = text_train_valid_filtrado_stem[0:549367] #obtenemos los datos de train\n","text_valid_filtered = text_train_valid_filtrado_stem[549367:] #obtenemos los datos de valid"],"execution_count":26,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"NNF5P0PqJmYo"},"source":["Entrenamos un modelo con las hipotesis de train filtradas y obtenemos los resultados de submit"]},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/","height":490},"id":"Eb9z1VulZD53","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1633359539401,"user_tz":180,"elapsed":12202,"user":{"displayName":"Maria Teresita Laguinge","photoUrl":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a/default-user=s64","userId":"16772265715389943262"}},"outputId":"28c02ca8-22c4-4686-89e2-7058259e255d"},"source":["results = run_NBMN_test(text_train_filtered,labels_train,text_valid_filtered,labels_val,text_test_filtrado,tf_idf_=True,alpha_ = 1,min_df_=0.000002, max_df_=0.8, ngram_range_ = (1,2))\n","results"],"execution_count":null,"outputs":[{"output_type":"stream","name":"stdout","text":["training model...\n","evaluating hyperparameters...\n"]},{"output_type":"execute_result","data":{"text/html":["<div>\n","<style scoped>\n","    .dataframe tbody tr th:only-of-type {\n","        vertical-align: middle;\n","    }\n","\n","    .dataframe tbody tr th {\n","        vertical-align: top;\n","    }\n","\n","    .dataframe thead th {\n","        text-align: right;\n","    }\n","</style>\n","<table border=\"1\" class=\"dataframe\">\n","  <thead>\n","    <tr style=\"text-align: right;\">\n","      <th></th>\n","      <th>pred_labels</th>\n","    </tr>\n","    <tr>\n","      <th>pairID</th>\n","      <th></th>\n","    </tr>\n","  </thead>\n","  <tbody>\n","    <tr>\n","      <th>0</th>\n","      <td>contradiction</td>\n","    </tr>\n","    <tr>\n","      <th>1</th>\n","      <td>neutral</td>\n","    </tr>\n","    <tr>\n","      <th>2</th>\n","      <td>neutral</td>\n","    </tr>\n","    <tr>\n","      <th>3</th>\n","      <td>entailment</td>\n","    </tr>\n","    <tr>\n","      <th>4</th>\n","      <td>neutral</td>\n","    </tr>\n","    <tr>\n","      <th>...</th>\n","      <td>...</td>\n","    </tr>\n","    <tr>\n","      <th>9819</th>\n","      <td>entailment</td>\n","    </tr>\n","    <tr>\n","      <th>9820</th>\n","      <td>entailment</td>\n","    </tr>\n","    <tr>\n","      <th>9821</th>\n","      <td>contradiction</td>\n","    </tr>\n","    <tr>\n","      <th>9822</th>\n","      <td>entailment</td>\n","    </tr>\n","    <tr>\n","      <th>9823</th>\n","      <td>neutral</td>\n","    </tr>\n","  </tbody>\n","</table>\n","<p>9824 rows × 1 columns</p>\n","</div>"],"text/plain":["          pred_labels\n","pairID               \n","0       contradiction\n","1             neutral\n","2             neutral\n","3          entailment\n","4             neutral\n","...               ...\n","9819       entailment\n","9820       entailment\n","9821    contradiction\n","9822       entailment\n","9823          neutral\n","\n","[9824 rows x 1 columns]"]},"metadata":{},"execution_count":79}]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"2MvaeVIZYYNi"},"source":[""]}]}
